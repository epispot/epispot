"""
The `native` module contains various plotting mechanisms utilizing `matplotlib`.
Additionally, in order to display scientifically polished graphs, this module uses the
[Science-Plots](https://pypi.org/project/SciencePlots/1.0.8/) package.\
We strongly encourage you to cite the authors of this package as demonstrated below:

> John Garrett. (2021, June 2). SciencePlots (v1.0.8) (Version 1.0.8). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893230

Unfortunately, the `SciencePlots` package is only available on `pip` at this time.
If you use an Anaconda system, you should still have no problem installing it since `pip` comes pre-installed with most versions.
Install with:
```shell
pip install SciencePlots
```

Additionally, all functions in this module have a `latex` flag which determines whether to use LaTeX or not.
In order to use LaTeX, please follow the installation instructions for your operating system listed on the
[`SciencePlots` project README](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots#faq).  <!-- spellcheck: disable -->
