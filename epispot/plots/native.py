"""
The `epispot.plots.native` module contains various plotting mechanisms utilizing `matplotlib`.
Additionally, in order to display scientifically polished graphs, this module uses the
[Science-Plots](https://pypi.org/project/SciencePlots/1.0.8/) package.\
We strongly encourage you to cite the authors of this package as demonstrated below:

> John Garrett. (2021, June 2). SciencePlots (v1.0.8) (Version 1.0.8). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893230

Unfortunately, the `SciencePlots` package is only available on `pip` at this time.
If you use an Anaconda system, you should still have no problem installing it since `pip` comes pre-installed with most versions.
Install with:

```shell
pip install SciencePlots
```

Additionally, all functions in this module have a `latex` flag which determines whether to use LaTeX or not.
In order to use LaTeX, please follow the installation instructions for your operating system listed on the
[`SciencePlots` project README](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots#faq).

    """
    Plots the results of one model using `matplotlib`.
    The results are displayed natively via a `matplotlib` window.
    There are various ways to customize the generated plots by modifying the time frame or compartments displayed.
    Additionally, `matplotlib` allows editing plots even after they have been created to change things like colors,
    margins, etc.

    ## Parameters

    `model (epispot.models.Model)`: A `epispot.models.Model` object

    `time_frame (range)`: A `range()` describing the time period to plot;
        use `timesteps=` keyword argument to use `np.linspace` as the `time_frame` is simply for the x-axis

    `title='Compartment Populations over Time' (str)`: The title of the plot

    `show_susceptible=False (bool)`: Boolean value describing whether or not to plot the Susceptible compartment.

    ..important::
        This assumes that the Susceptible compartment is the first in `Model`

    ..note::
        This can potentially result in less visibility for other compartments
        since usually the Susceptible compartment comprises of many, many
        more individuals than the other compartments combined.

    `log=False (bool)`: Boolean value indicating whether or not to use a logarithmic scale when plotting `Model`

    `latex=True (bool)`: Turn off if you do not have LaTeX installed or want quicker loading times

    `**kwargs**`: Keyword arguments to pass into `epispot.models.Model.integrate()`

    ## Returns

    `pyplot` figure (display with `.show()`) containing the graph (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`)
