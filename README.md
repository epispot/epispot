A tool for creating and testing epidemiological models faster than ever for the mathematical modeling of infectious 
diseases. An idea from https://github.com/henrifroese/infectious_disease_modelling.

**Nightly Build**

<br>

## Installation

Epispot nightly can _only_ be installed on pip at this time.
Install with:
```
pip install epispot-nightly
```
As a shorthand, use `import epinightly as epi`.
Epispot nightly should be imported as `epinightly` to avoid confusion with the `epispot` package.
This means both packages can be used in the same program, though this is not recommended.

## Getting Started

Make sure you are already familiar with epispot. Each release of epispot nightly will have detailed release notes and additional documentation. 
These can be found **here--change after docs are created**
