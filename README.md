## Documentation
This is where documentation is stored! Epispot's documentation is auto-generated from the [`nightly`](https://www.github.com/epispot/epispot/tree/nightly) and 
dumped here. Epispot currently uses `pdoc3` to generate documentation. However, if you interested in helping documentation efforts at epispot, please do **not**
change the documentation here as it will be overridden by the next auto-generated docs. Instead, fork the nightly branch and change the source docstrings. 
You can view more instructions on how to do this by reading [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://www.github.com/epispot/epispot/tree/nightly/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Translating
Epispot documentation is currently being translated via [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/5997). If you would like to translate epispot's docs, 
start translating any file and submit a review request. Currently epispot documentation is being made available in the following languages (stored under their 
respective sub-directories):
