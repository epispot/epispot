Documentation can easily be accessed from function, class, and file docstrings.
Doc strings provide additional documentation on a certain function.
They can be accessed by the built-in Python `help()` command.
These strings are formatted in Github-flavored markdown.
Additionally, all files will have a 'STRUCTURE' label. For tutorials, see 
`tests/tutorials`. All tutorials contain `.md` files and their 
corresponding code.
