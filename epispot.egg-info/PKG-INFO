        ## Features
        
         - SIR-based models
            - Susceptible
            - Infected
            - Recovered
            - Exposed
            - Dead
            - Critical
            - Hospitalized
            
         - Custom-defined compartmental models
            - Create custom models using the `Model` class
         
         - Graphing Capabilities
            - Plot real data from a `.csv` file
            - Plot model predictions interactively
            - Compare different model predictions
        
        ## Compile your model at the speed of light

        Documentation can easily be accessed from function, class, and file docstrings.
        Doc strings provide additional documentation on a certain function.
        They can be accessed by the built-in Python `help()` command.
        These strings are formatted in Github-flavored markdown.
        Additionally, all files will have a 'STRUCTURE' label.
